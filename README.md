## 👋 Hi, I'm Katz

🎓 I'm currently a **PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering** at **UC Davis**.

🤖 I started my journey in **robotics**, driven by a deep fascination with building things that move and think.  
Early on, I built systems like a **Rubik’s cube-solving robot 🧩** and a **3D self-balancing cube 🧊** — full-stack designs that combined **perception 👁️**, **control 🎮**, and a bit of algorithmic **magic ✨**.

🔍 Later, I shifted gears into **computational imaging**, especially for **3D reconstruction 🧱** of natural objects.  
I became fascinated with **light fields 💡**, **inverse problems 🔄**, and how we can recover shape and texture from limited data.

🔬 Now, my research focuses on **computational microscopy 🧠**, exploring how we can use **physics-informed neural networks 🤯** and **optics 🔬** to image neural activity with high speed and resolution.
